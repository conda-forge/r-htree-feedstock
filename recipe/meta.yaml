  summary: Historical regression trees are an extension of standard trees,  producing a non-parametric
    estimate of how the response depends on  all of its prior realizations as well as
    that of any time-varying predictor  variables. The method applies equally to regularly
    as well as irregularly  sampled data. The package implements random forest and boosting
    ensembles  based on historical regression trees, suitable for longitudinal data.  Standard
    error estimation and Z-score variable importance is also implemented.
